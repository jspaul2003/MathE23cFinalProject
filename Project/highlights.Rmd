## Abstract

The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 276K people and infected a confirmed 3.97M. This open-ended project was intended to explore deathtolls and deathrates, hopefully providing insight as to what affects these and what can be done to reduce this.
